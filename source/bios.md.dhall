${teacherBio "CalebAlexander.JPG" "Caleb Alexander" "Geaux Teach Student" "Louisiana State University" "I'm 21 years old from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I'm currently a senior student attending LSU majoring in Mathematics Secondary Education and minoring in Computer Science. Even though I still have a little while before being certified to teach, I still have some field experience with teaching in the K-12 school system. My goals for this summer training is to see how the Pathways program can build a better foundation in the STEM courses, get some experience in learning the course with other teachers from across the U.S., and learn how to teach the course to students to help get more in STEM. I hope to bring experience from this summer training to the Geauxteach program at LSU, so others can participate in this program to help benefit their teaching experience through their majors."}
